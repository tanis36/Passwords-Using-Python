"Hey! I hope your day is going well!"

Thanks! I hope yours is too! We still on for dinner later?

"Totally! Matt and Diane asked if we wanted to join them for bowling after dinner."

That sounds like a lot of fun! Let them know we're in!

"Will do! I'm excited to see you! Miss and love you <3"

Same here! Miss and love you too <3
